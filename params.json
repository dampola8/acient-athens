  "body": "# ANCIENT ATHENS\r\n## athens\r\n### Athens was the largest and most powerful Greek state. It was a city with lots of beautiful public buildings, shops and public baths. The people of Athens lived below the Acropolis (rocky hill). The marble Parthenon, a temple, (see picture above) was built on the highest part of the Acropolis.\r\n## Wars\r\n### The Most Important Battles Of Ancient Greece: Battle of Marathon, 490 BC. The Battle of Marathon took place during the first Persian invasion of Greece, fought between the combined forces of Athens and Plataea against King Darius' Persian army.\r\n## Slaves\r\n### Slavery played a major role in ancient Greek civilization. Slaves could be found everywhere. They worked not only as domestic servants, but as factory workers, shopkeepers, Mineworkers, farm workers and as ship's crewmembers. There may have been as many, if not more, slaves than free people in ancient Greece\r\n## Medicine\r\n### Hippocrates, known as the \"Father of Modern Medicine\", established a medical school at Cos and is the most important figure in ancient Greek medicine. Hippocrates and his students documented numerous illnesses in the Hippocratic Corpus, and developed the Hippocratic Oath for physicians, which is still in use today.\r\n## Farming\r\n### Farming in ancient Greece was difficult due to the limited amount of good soil and cropland. It is estimated that only twenty percent of the land was usable for growing crops. The main crops were barley, grapes, and olives. Grain crops, such as barley and wheat, were planted in October and harvested in April or May.\r\n![Ancient Greece Farming](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-urYD1iWHDaA/VbpRNSk6vrI/AAAAAAAAJrg/mxSyb11q-9Q/s1600/g4.png)\r\n## houses\r\n### Ancient Greece. The Parthenon, a temple dedicated to Athena, located on the Acropolis in Athens, is one of the most representative symbols of the culture and sophistication of the ancient Greeks.Most Greek houses were small, with a walled garden or yard in the middle. The house was made of sun-dried mud brick. Mud houses crumbled away in a few years, and had to rebuild. So archaeologists do not dig up the ruins of Ancient Greek homes.\r\n## WHAT DID THEY WEAR\r\n### Most Greek houses were small, with a walled garden or yard in the middle.
